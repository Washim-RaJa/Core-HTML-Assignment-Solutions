            <h5>UX Design</h5>
            UX design involves designing the app's user experience, mainly how they interact with it. <br/>
            UX designers are responsible for the app’s structure, functionality, organization, and how its different elements work together.<br/>
            Ultimately, the UX designer’s job is to give the user a good experience with the app.
            <h5>UI Design</h5>
            UI design deals with the user interface and the app's graphical layout.<br/>
            This design covers the buttons users click, the text they see, text entry fields, images, sliders, etc.<br/>
            UI covers any item the user interacts with, including transitions, screen layout, interface animations, and every micro-interaction.<br/>
            Any part of the app that the user sees and interacts with must be designed, and that's the UI designer's job.
